# Python for Data Analytics (U21OIT04) Capstone Project

An end-to-end Data Analytics and Machine Learning project built on the **Online Retail II dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository)**.  
The system transforms 500,000+ UK retail transactions into structured customer intelligence and an executive-style dashboard.

## Project Scope
- Data quality profiling and structured preprocessing  
- Customer-level feature engineering (RFM-style behavioral metrics)  
- Revenue prediction using regression models  
- High-value customer classification  
- Model comparison and feature importance analysis  
- Executive dashboard built with Streamlit  

## Dataset
**Online Retail II Dataset**  
UK-based online retail transactions  
Period: December 2009 – December 2010  
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
